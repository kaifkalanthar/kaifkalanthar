# üí´ About Me:
<br>Hi, I'm Mohamed Kaif üëã<br><br>I'm currently pursuing my 2nd undergraduate degree at Sri Krishna Arts and Science College. I have been interested in programming since my 12th grade, and started learning Java. I have solved numerous problems on HackerRank and obtained a Java certification from them. <br><br>My interest in technology led me to learn frontend development. I started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by watching YouTube videos, and then moved on to learning React.js. In just 4 months, I completed the React.js course and created several projects including a blogging website, personal portfolio, and an ecommerce website.<br><br>I am passionate about becoming a software developer and believe that good software can make the world a better place. I am a self-learner and always enthusiastic to learn new things. I enjoy working with people because I believe we can learn a lot from one another.<br><br>I have been learning programming for over 3 years now, and I continue to learn every day. I strongly believe that consistency is key to achieving success. If you're interested in connecting or learning more, feel free to reach out to me!
