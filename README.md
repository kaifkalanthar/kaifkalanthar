# üí´ About Me:
<br>Hi, I'm Mohamed Kaif üëã<br><br>I'm currently pursuing my 2nd undergraduate degree at Sri Krishna Arts and Science College. I have been interested in programming since my 12th grade, and started learning Java. I have solved numerous problems on HackerRank and obtained a Java certification from them. I have always been curious about technology and have wondered about the process of creating software.<br><br>My interest in technology led me to learn frontend development. I started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by watching YouTube videos, and then moved on to learning React.js. In just 4 months, I completed the React.js course and created several projects including a blogging website, personal portfolio, and an ecommerce website.<br><br>I am passionate about becoming a software developer and believe that good software can make the world a better place. I am a self-learner and always enthusiastic to learn new things. I enjoy working with people because I believe we can learn a lot from one another.<br><br>I have been learning programming for over 3 years now, and I continue to learn every day. I strongly believe that consistency is key to achieving success. If you're interested in connecting or learning more, feel free to reach out to me!

## 2. SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage Landing Prediction
<ul>
  <li>To predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.</li>
  <li>To determine the cost of a launch by determining if the first stage will land. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.</li>
  <li>SpaceX can reuse the first stage of the rocket, saving a significant amount of money on launches. By predicting the success of the landing, the cost of the launch can be determined, making it easier for other companies to compete with SpaceX.</li>
  <li>Cost comparison: SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches for 62 million dollars, while other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each.</li>
  <li>A predictive model will be developed to determine the success of the landing of the first stage.</li>
  <li>Data Science techniques: Data Collection, Data Preprocessing, Data Exploration, Feature Engineering, Model Building, Model Evaluation.</li>
  <li>Expected outcome: An accurate predictive model that can be used to determine the success of the landing of the Falcon 9 first stage.</li>
</ul>
